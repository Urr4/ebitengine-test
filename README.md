# Testing the Ebitengine

This project is intended for playing around with the ebitengine and raylib and try game dev in go.
Currently it doesn't do much more than follow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iWp-mCIQgMU&list=PLVotA8ycjnCsy30WQCwVU5RrZkt4lLgY5 but hopefully I can add on that in the future.

If you want to start this, just run `go run main.go` in the root folder.
If your on windows, you might need a C-Compiler (see https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go#windows)
